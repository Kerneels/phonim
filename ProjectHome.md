# Phonim - Speech and Braille for Vim #

Phonim assist programmers who are blind or partially sighted  by unleashing the incredible power and efficiency of the vim text editor  through delivering configurable auditory and tactile feedback of everything that is happening on screen.

Efficient and powerful text manipulation is the key skill every programmer can't do without, and this is especially true for  a computer professional who has trouble visually reading source .

Although platform specific solutions for accessible expert text editing do exist, there is no consistent, platform independent and configurable solution for vim-style editing

If you have only been exposed to the editing style where the cursor position is moved with the keyboard arrow keys, the mouse, and where extra functions requires the holding down of modifier keys like Ctrl, Shift and Alt, it would be difficult for you to appreciate the performance gain possible when one is able to keep your fingers on the home row ('a', 's', 'd', 'f', 'j', 'k', 'l', ';') and still be able to perform 90% of editing tasks as is possible with vim.

## How it works... ##

Phonim aims to make vim speak and produce Braille output by providing a set of cross platform solutions that bridges vim's screen output with any other existing resident AT (accessibility technology) software available on the particular platform. It is therefore a collection of projects with a similar goal.

In order to accomplish this a combination of approaches are explored in the wiki pages, with the hope that the most successful and feasible approach for each platform will be implemented.

Start with the [Approach](Approach.md) page in the wiki to get a general overview of the various solutions.

## Yes, I love VIM and want to help with this project ##

My name is Kerneels. If you want to help, please contact me by emailing to my name on the email service Google provides (a n t i s p a m  t r i c k :-) I'll add you  to the project and you can start contributing in any of these ways:

  * Review and edit  the wiki content and comment to make suggestions.
  * Pursue the design or implementation of one of the platform solutions with which you are most familiar with, and where you have the relevant skills.
  * Take up one of the coding tasks.
  * Sponsor phonim development.
  * Download and test.

This is a golden opportunity for you to do something exceptional and give the gift of liberty to computer users relying on speech and Braille to access and alter cyberspace.

Your help could empower someone who is blind or partially sighted to compete more equally in the workplace, and share the awesomeness of vim with everyone.

## Learn Once, Apply Everywhere and Forever ##

Wouldn't it be great to be able to apply a hard earned proficiency at something everywhere, no matter on what platform you find yourself having to work on, and do this throughout the years of your working career?Well, this is the reality and freedom that sighted users of the ubiquitous vim text editor are enjoying right now. The power of vim is available to them in almost every existing operating system.

If we can make the Phonim project a success then computer users relying on speech and Braille feedback can be set free in this similar fashion.

The task is difficult and complex, but the eventual success of the project would mean a great deal for anyone who wishes to edit text efficiently but who has difficulty reading a computer screen. It would enable such a person to hear the contents of the editor window, and this on any platform supported by the Phonim project. I have confidence that the community can make this work!

## Supported Platforms ##

Currently the planned supported platforms are Windows, Mac and Linux.
